# Dental-Image-Tooth-Localization-and-Numbering
- Challenge by IndabaX Tunisia 2024
- This is the work of the Amilcar team composed by Ben Zekri Yassine, Sanaa Nidhal and me.

# Objectif: 
  - Automate tooth localization and numbering for enhanced efficiency and precision.
    
# Solution:
  - Leveraged a YOLOv8x model with an attention layer, fine-tuning the AI model to accurately detect and labelize teeth from occlusion-rendered images of 3D intraoral scans.

# Dataset:
The Dataset could be found on the hackathon page on the Zindi platform here : https://zindi.africa/competitions/dental-image-tooth-localization-and-numbering-challenge-by-indabax-tunisia-2024/data
